# DistanceBetweenPointsCalculator.py
A Python 3 Math challenge using unit tests.
**Goal:**
----------
Write a python function that calculates the distance between 2 points on a 2D cartesian grid (x1, y1) & (x2, y2)
Based on The Distance Formula
[# mathwarehouse.com] (http://www.mathwarehouse.com/algebra/distance_formula/index.php)

**Inputs:**
----------
* **calculateDistanceBetween()** receives four inputs (all integers): x1, y1, x2, y2
  * x1 & y1 are the x, y coordinates for the first point
  * x2 & y2 are the x, y coordinates for the second point

**Outputs:**
------------
* **calculateDistanceBetween()** returns 1 output (a float) rounded to the 2nd digit:
    * you will need to use a the round() function

**Notes/Challenge Opportunity**
-------------
* This challenge does not deal with incorrect input (I'll save that for another challenge)

**Examples:**
inputs => output/s
--------------------------------
* 6 8 0 0 => 10.0
* 2 4 26 9 => 24.52
* 4 6 28 13 => 25.0
* 24 1 13 30 => 31.02
* -10 1 -20 10 => 13.45
* -6 -2 20 10 => 28.64
* 60 20 -20 -10 => 85.44
* 10 5 6 2 => 5.0
